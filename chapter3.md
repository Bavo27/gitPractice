# Spotting the Enemy

One day, while playing Clash Royale, Chenhao noticed something strange. He won a match easily, but immediately after, his screen flickered. A pop-up appeared showing a mysterious message: "Level up your skills in real life. Join us." Curious,  Chenhao clicked it, and the screen morphed into a dazzling light. The colors swirled, and suddenly he was not in his room anymore Chenhao found himself inside the game, in a digital world that looked just like the Clash Royale arena but vastly more vibrant. He could feel the energy around him. The characters he had played with before were now real. They moved and spoke, waiting for him to take action. Chenhao was both excited and scared. He had always dreamed of being part of his favorite game, but this was more than he had ever wished for.
