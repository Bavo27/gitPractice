# Chapter 1

Chenhao was a computer science student with a passion for technology and a love for games. Every day, he would sit at his desk, surrounded by stacks of books, a laptop glowing softly in the dim light of his room. With his headphones on, he would listen to Lauveyâ€™s soothing music, which filled him with inspiration as he worked on his projects.

Every afternoon, after classes, Chenhao had a routine. He brewed a cup of matcha tea, the bright green color bringing a sense of calm as he sat down. The warm drink warmed his hands and fueled his mind. He loved the earthy taste of matcha. It was his secret weapon for staying focused while coding.
